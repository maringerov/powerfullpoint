					<p>Knowledge is important. And knowledge transfer - the combination of teaching and learning, is just as important. Why is it constantly being ruined is a mystery to me. Let’s take a few steps back to get a perspective.</p>
											
					<p>I am a graduate student at the largest research institution on the planet, a host of 27 Nobel Prize laureates and some of the most prominent scientists in the world. As such, I had been lucky to have visited many other institutions in many different countries. There I have been a witness to hundreds of lectures. Hundreds of different types of presentation styles. Some of them I loved, but many (way too many to mention) made me yawn like a varsity captain at an advanced calculus class. And slides with a black text on a blue background were not the worst I have seen, believe me.</p>
					<p>Things did not seem to differ too much on a research level. I have done my share of group meetings where results of hard science were discussed and I was lost in translation. Department meetings went a step further into mental chaos.</p>

					<p>Brilliant minds, brilliant ideas and results just bounced off the audience.</p>
										
					<p>Communication between the mentor and the student is the way human civilization actually worked. The power of exchanging knowledge and moving people towards progress is the backbone of the civilized world as we know it today. But somewhere along the way knowledge transfer has turned into a mundane process that only a handful of people could master. Communicators didn’t care about the impact their work has on their audience. In turn, the audience didn’t care about the communicators or the knowledge they could offer.</p>

					<p>Marin and I met already at high school and even then we had glorious plans of revolutionizing the education system. Perhaps it was our shared frustration at math classes, we might never know. Fast forward 8 years and we are sitting in a cafe in Bremen. What was said is not important, but when we closed the door behind us and sipped on a steamy cup of tea, we had an idea - that we must challenge old habits and help communicators improve the way they lecture and present. Then and there we started our journey towards defining and exploring the new realm of knowledge transfer - Lectureology.</p>
